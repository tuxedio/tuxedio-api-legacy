#Readme for Instructors

We completed a majority of the work we intended in our proposal. 
The biggest part of our proposal was getting an activity itinerary working. There are two user types: vendors and customers. Vendors can create activiites, that show up on the explore page. Customers can visit the explore page and add activities to a trip itinerary that is sorted by activity time.

There were two parts that we dropped from our final project that were in our proposal: a blog, and a user's top 3 picks page.
The top 3 picks has backend code to store the picks, but we did not have time to integrate it into our actiivites list to make selecting these top three picks easy for our end user.
